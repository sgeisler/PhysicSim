Yet another physics simulation library
=======================================

This will become a more or less accurate physics simulation library. It's just for fun, but maybe it's useful for demonstration purposes. In the end it will be integrated into a program, which provides an interface to the simulation using 3D graphics.

Goals:
------
* detect and simulate collisions
* simulate electrostatic, electromagnetic and gravitational effects
* objects resting on each other
* provide different integration methods

Models:
-------
* force
* momentum
* torque
* angular momentum


*to be continued*
