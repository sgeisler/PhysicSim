Just another physics simulation library
=======================================

This will become a more or less accurate physics simulation library. It's just for fun, but maybe it's useful for demonstration purposes.

Goals:
------
* detect and simulate collisions
* simulate electrostatic, electromagnetic and gravitational effects
	* (maybe magnetic fields as well)
* objects resting on each other
* provide different integration methods

Models:
-------
* force
* momentum
* angular momentum

*to be continued*
