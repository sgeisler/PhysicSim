Just another physics simulation library
=======================================

This will become a more or less accurate physics simulation library. It's just for fun, but maybe it's usefull for demonstration purposes.

Goals:
------
* detect and simulate collisions
* simulate electrostatic, electromagnetic and gravitational effects
* objects resting on each other

Models:
-------
* force
* pulse

*to be continued*
